# 4-8-2 (Mountain type)

In [[Whyte notation]], the '''4-8-2 wheel arrangement''' (known as the '''Mountain type''' in North America or the '''MN class''' in certain Commonwealth countries) is a [[steam locomotive]] that uses the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and two trailing wheels. This configuration was developed to address the increasing demands for power and speed in passenger service on mountainous terrain, hence its common name.

## Development and characteristics

The 4-8-2 wheel arrangement evolved from the earlier [[4-6-2 (Pacific)|Pacific type (4-6-2)]] as railroads sought locomotives capable of hauling heavier passenger trains at sustained speeds across challenging topography. The addition of a fourth pair of driving wheels increased tractive effort significantly while maintaining a relatively high speed capability. The arrangement's key characteristics include:

* '''Lead truck''': The four-wheel leading truck (two axles) provided stability at higher speeds and improved tracking on curved track.
* '''Driver wheelbase''': The eight coupled driving wheels (four axles) delivered greater adhesion and tractive effort compared to the Pacific type.
* '''Trailing truck''': The two-wheel trailing truck (single axle) supported a larger [[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] than was possible with the Pacific type, allowing for increased steam generation and power output.

The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] is generally credited with introducing the first 4-8-2 locomotive in North America in 1911, designed specifically for passenger service in the Allegheny Mountains. The [[New York Central Railroad]] later developed some of the most advanced examples with their L-3 and L-4 classes, featuring streamlined shrouding and capable of speeds exceeding 85 mph (137 km/h).

Outside North America, notable implementations included the [[South African Railways Class 16]] introduced in the 1920s and the [[Victorian Railways X class]] in Australia, both designed for similar mountainous operating conditions.

While less numerous than the ubiquitous [[4-6-2 (Pacific)|Pacific]] or the powerful [[2-8-2 (Mikado)|Mikado]] types, the Mountain type represented an important evolutionary step in steam locomotive development, bridging the gap between these earlier designs and later, more specialized heavy power such as the [[4-8-4 (Northern)|Northern type]].
