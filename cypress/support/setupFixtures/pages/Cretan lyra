The '''Cretan lyra''' ({{lang-el|Κρητική λύρα}}) is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[pear-shaped]], three-stringed bowed [[Greek musical instruments|musical instrument]], central to the traditional [[music of Crete]] and other islands in the [[Dodecanese]] and the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] Archipelago, in [[Greece]]. The Cretan lyra is considered to be the most popular surviving form of the medieval [[Byzantine lyra]], an ancestor of most European bowed instruments. ==Playing style== The lyra is held vertically on the player's lap, in the same way as a small [[viol]], rather than being placed under the chin of the player like a [[violin]]. For normal right-handed playing, the player's right hand holds the bow. The strings are stopped by pressing the fingernails of the player's left hand against the side of the string, rather than by pressing the string against the fingerboard. This gives it a different tone from the violin. Older lyras (lyrakis) have one string which is normally not fingered and is used as a [[Drone (music)|drone]], playing the same note while tunes are played on the other two strings ==Origins== The Cretan lyra is closely related to the bowed Byzantine lyra, the ancestor of many European bowed instruments. The 9th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] (d. 911), in his lexicographical discussion of instruments, cited the lyra as a typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' ([[Organ (music)|organ]]), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]) (Margaret J. Kartomi, 1990). The Byzantine lyra spread westward through Europe with uncertain evolution; a notable example is the Italian ''[[lira da braccio]]'', a 15th-century bowed instrument and possibly the predecessor of the modern [[violin]]. Bowed instruments similar to the Cretan lyra and direct descendants of the Byzantine lyra have continued to be played in many post-Byzantine regions until the present day with small changes, for example the ''[[Gadulka]]'' in [[Bulgaria]], the bowed [[Calabrian lira]] in [[Italy]] and the [[Kemenche#Classical Kemenche|Classical Kemenche]] (Turkish: ''Armudî kemençe'', Greek: Πολίτικη λύρα) in [[Istanbul]], Turkey. With regard to the period of introduction of the bowed instrument in the island, there are four schools of thought: #The Byzantine lyra was introduced after 961 AD, when the island was reconquered from Arabs by the [[Byzantine Empire]] under the command of [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]. At that time, noble families from Constantinople were sent to settle on Crete to inject new life and replenish the Greek population, who introduced many Byzantine traditions from Constantinople. #The lyra was introduced from the islands of the [[Dodecanese]], and ''entered'' the island through the eastern town of [[Sitia]] (where it was most popular), which is the neighbor of [[Kassos]] and [[Karpathos]]; this must have happened by the 12th century. #The lyra was gradually introduced into the island's traditions as a popular element of the [[Byzantine music]] and tradition, in a similar manner that lyra was introduced in other regions (e.g. the ''Lira da braccio'' and Calabrian ''lira'' in Italy and the [[Gadulka]] in Bulgaria). #By the local tradition, the Cretan lyra has been spontaneous developed in the island of Crete some time before the year 961 AD and after the Byzantine invasion of Nikephoros Phokas it's been adopted by the Byzantine panspermia among other treasures from Crete, to Istanbul, and from there, spread east and west. Over the centuries and especially during the island's [[History of Crete#Venetian and Ottoman Crete|Venetian era]], the [[violin]] exerted its influence on the [[music of Crete]] both under the organological and musical aspect, bringing about profound changes in the instrument's [[repertory]], tunning, [[organology]], musical language and performance practice. ==Types== There are three major types of Cretan lyras: #the '''''lyraki''''' (Greek: λυράκι), a small model of lyra, almost identical to the Byzantine lyra, used only for the performance of dances (Anoyanakis, 1976) #the '''''vrontolyra''''' (Greek: βροντόλυρα), which has a very strong sound, ideal for accompaniment of songs #the '''common lyra''' (Greek: λύρα κοινή), popular in the island today; designed based on the combination of lyraki with the [[violin]]. The influence of the violin caused the transformation of many features of the old form of Cretan Lyra (''lyraki'') into the contemporary lyra, including its tuning, performance practice, and [[repertory]]. In 1920, the ''viololyra'' was developed in an effort by local instrument manufacturers to give the sound and the technical possibilities of the violin to the old Byzantine ''lyraki''. Twenty years later a new combination of ''lyraki'' and violin gave birth to the common lyra. Other types include the '''four-stringed lyra'''. In 1990, [[Ross Daly]] designed a new type of Cretan lyra which incorporates elements of lyraki, the Byzantine lyra and the Indian [[sarangi]]. The result was a lyra with three playing strings of 29cm in length (the same as the standard Cretan lyra), and 18 sympathetic strings which resonate on Indian-styled jawari bridges (the number of sympathetic strings was later increased to 22). ==Construction== The Lyra has a body (''kafka'', or ''kafki'') with a pear-shaped [[Sounding board|soundboard]] (''kapaki''), or one which is essentially oval in shape, with two small semi-circular [[soundhole]]s.
