'''Eldfjall''' (Fire Mountain) is an active stratovolcano located in the southern highlands of Iceland, approximately 45 kilometers northeast of the town of Hella. The volcano rises to 1,847 meters above sea level and is part of the Eastern Volcanic Zone, one of Iceland's most geologically active regions.
==Geology==
Eldfjall is classified as a stratovolcano composed primarily of basaltic andesite and dacite layers. The volcano sits above a magma chamber estimated to be 4-6 kilometers below the surface. Geothermal activity in the area includes several hot springs and fumaroles on the volcano's northern and eastern flanks. The volcano is monitored continuously by the Icelandic Meteorological Office due to its active status.
==Eruption History==
The first documented eruption of Eldfjall occurred in 1362, as recorded in medieval Icelandic annals. Subsequent eruptions have been recorded in 1477, 1593, 1721, and most recently in 1891. The 1891 eruption lasted approximately three weeks and produced a lava flow that extended 8 kilometers to the east, though it caused no casualties due to the remote location. Seismic activity suggests the volcano remains active, with minor earthquake swarms detected every few years.
==Tourism and Hiking==

==Flora and Fauna==
The lower slopes of Eldfjall support limited vegetation typical of Icelandic highlands, including moss, lichen, and hardy grasses. Arctic foxes and various bird species, including the common raven and snow bunting, inhabit the area. The barren upper slopes above 1,200 meters remain largely devoid of vegetation due to volcanic activity and harsh weather conditions.
==Access==
Eldfjall can be reached via the F-roads F228 and F261, which are accessible only during summer months (typically July to September) and require four-wheel-drive vehicles. The standard hiking route to the summit begins at a parking area near Eldfjallssk√°li hut and takes approximately 5-6 hours round trip. Hikers are advised to check weather conditions and volcanic activity alerts before attempting the ascent.
