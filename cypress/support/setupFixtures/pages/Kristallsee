'''Kristallsee''' (Crystal Lake) is a natural freshwater lake located in the Bavarian Alps of southern Germany, approximately 15 kilometers southeast of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The lake sits at an elevation of 1,247 meters above sea level and covers an area of 2.3 square kilometers.

== Geography ==
Kristallsee is situated within the Ammergau Alps nature reserve, nestled between the peaks of Kleiner Kristallberg (1,892m) and Gro√üer Kristallberg (2,156m). The lake has a maximum depth of 47 meters and is fed primarily by underground springs and seasonal snowmelt from the surrounding mountains. The lake's outlet flows north through the Kristallbach stream, which eventually joins the Loisach River.

== History ==
The lake was first documented in 1547 by Bavarian cartographer Johann Huber, who noted its exceptional clarity in his regional surveys. During the 19th century, the area became popular with Romantic painters, including several works by lesser-known members of the Munich School.

== Ecology ==
The lake supports populations of brown trout, Arctic char, and European perch. The surrounding forests are home to red deer, roe deer, and occasionally golden eagles. The area has been designated as a Natura 2000 site since 2004 due to its pristine alpine ecosystem and rare plant species, including the protected Bavarian gentian.
